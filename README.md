[How to Fight Climate Change as a Software Engineer](https://www.infoq.com/articles/fight-climate-change-software-engineer/)

## Thoughts on Article
Fighting climate change, I believe, is the responsibility of all rational beings that live on this earth – including software developers. As someone who wants to break into the software engineering industry and who attempts to be cognizant of the way their activities impact the environment, I found this article extremely insightful. Beyond recognizing the impact that software has on greenhouse gas emissions, it encourages aspiring software developers to think about the environmental aspect of their software engineering decisions. Working for large tech companies that contribute immensely to climate change, software developers could at the very least actively incorporate eco-friendly developer habits into their workflow.  

## Comment by JonasonWu (jw5911)
This article tells me that software engineers could combat climate change by reducing the amount of resources that the software needs for operation. Although this is an interesting idea, it would also mean that developers will have to spend time figuring out the most energy-efficient method to write the software. This is generally difficult for developers who work on software projects with tight schedules. There might not be enough time to consider how to write the software efficiently because of an approaching deadline.
